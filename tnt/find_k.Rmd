title: "Find K"

In this notebook, we will check the results of the implied weighting sensitivity analysis.

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
```

Let's load the results.
```{r}
k_res = read_csv('out.txt')

k_res
```

```{r}
plot(1:nrow(k_res),k_res$difspr)
```

It seems that k25 and above correspond to the same tree. So all of these values of k should be ok. Let's use 5.0:

```{r}
k_res[25:nrow(k_res),]
```
